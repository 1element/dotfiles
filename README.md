# Dotfiles

Collection of my dotfiles.

Mainly based on the dotfiles of [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and [paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

If you want to use these dotfiles, you should first review it and remove things you don't want or need. Use at your own risk.

## Overview

A quick overview of the included files.

Basic **shell environment** configuration:

* `.bash_profile`
* `.bash_prompt`
* `.exports`
* `.aliases`
* `.functions`

If `.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. It is not committed in this git repository and can be used for your private configuration.

Run `.macos` once on a fresh OS X/macOS installation to set some sensible defaults.

There is also a very basic global gitignore file `.gitignore_global`.
